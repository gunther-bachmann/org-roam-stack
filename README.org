#+title: org-roam-stack

provides functions to keep org-roam notes visibly in a stack

* General ideas

  This package aims to keep all roam document buffers in a stack of windows. It provides functions to add (existing) roam documents to the
  stack, navigate, remove or reorder them. It provides functions to maximize or balance the stack windows.

  - stack :: ordered list of org roam documents visually organized from top to bottom

* Rationale

  Creating stacks is a method of eliciting, of discovering new information, new aspects of some existing concepts manifested in cards. The
  idea combines ideas stemming from the zettelkasten method as well as experiences in building /bildstapel/ (picture stacks) in the area of
  political iconography.

  A stack of cards provides an additional perspective that could result in a new concept, an additional card. The stack could be interpreted
  as an argument, each card adding a certain aspect to this argument. The facet each card adds is not explictly stated. However the order
  and selection of the cards should carry this information. A stack could be interpreted as instantiations of a concept. The concept is an
  emergent aspect of the stack.

  This package strives to support this process.

* open items
** TODO make sure M-x f (open file) does not disrupt the stack
** TODO provide a function that brings the stack in a consistent state
   - e.g. analyse the current window setup and construct a stack accordingly
     - close all buffers that are not displayed (and not changed)
     - remove buffers visible but not part of the stack
     - organize stack (left window lane)
** TODO think about different visible window setups
   - currently the window setup strategy is keeping the stack in a left lane
   - this could also be changed to right, middle and multiple lanes
** TODO think about saving stack, visual stack setup, restore stack, relating stacks to cards, creating cards from stacks
