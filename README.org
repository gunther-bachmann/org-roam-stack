#+title: org-roam-stack

provides functions to keep org-roam notes visibly in a stack

* General ideas

  This package aims to keep all roam document buffers in a stack of windows. It provides functions to add (existing) roam documents to the
  stack, navigate, remove or reorder them. It provides functions to maximize or balance the stack windows.

  - stack :: ordered list of org roam documents visually organized from top to bottom

* Rationale

  Creating stacks is a method of eliciting, of discovering new information, new aspects of some existing concepts manifested in cards. The
  idea combines ideas stemming from the zettelkasten method as well as experiences in building /bildstapel/ (picture stacks) in the area of
  political iconography.

  A stack of cards provides an additional perspective that could result in a new concept, an additional card. The stack could be interpreted
  as an argument, each card adding a certain aspect to this argument. The facet each card adds is not explictly stated. However the order
  and selection of the cards should carry this information. A stack could be interpreted as instantiations of a concept. The concept is an
  emergent aspect of the stack.

  This package strives to support this process.

* open items
** TODO think about different visible window setups
   - currently the window setup strategy is keeping the stack in a left lane
   - this could also be changed to right, middle and multiple lanes
** TODO think about saving stack, visual stack setup, restore stack, relating stacks to cards, creating cards from stacks
** DONE provide a function that brings the stack in a consistent state
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2020-12-26 Sat 20:51]
   - e.g. analyse the current window setup and construct a stack accordingly
     - close all buffers that are not displayed (and not changed)
     - remove buffers visible but not part of the stack
     - organize stack (left window lane)
** DONE make sure reentering the stack opens the same card as the one just left
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2020-12-24 Thu 16:09]
   - identify all locations leaving the stack (or simple use buffer update function to record old card)
   - when entering stack, check whether the old (previous) card is still present, open that one instead
** DONE fix bug that opens any link into the stack, even though the document is not part of org roam
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2020-12-22 Tue 20:38]
** DONE make sure C-x C-f (find file) does not disrupt the stack
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2020-12-22 Tue 20:53]
** DONE open browser outside the stack (to the right)
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2020-12-24 Thu 15:54]
